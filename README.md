Graphics Research
=====
Code in this repository is for research in existing technologies for graphics useful in gamedev. It will contain benchmarks done in different technologies to compare their efficiency.


Some of the example graphics taken from http://opengameart.org/content/tuscan-knight-bleeds-game-art-hd and http://opengameart.org/content/unknown-horizons-tileset.

Update
-----
The main purpose of this repository was to do reasearch for an upcoming project that I'm taking part in. As we saw the potential in SFML early during the benchmarking done here, we decided
to give up on the rest of the planned frameworks, therefore I won't be updating this repository with rendering in other frameworks.
